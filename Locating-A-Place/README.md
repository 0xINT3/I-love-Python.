Here, I have used three modules namely, sys, pyperclip and webbrowser.
When you pass an address in the command prompt aka CMD using the keyword locate (as in my case), the location is automatically opened in your default browser.
For instance, C:\Users\Abhinav> locate 16B, Sector 16, Jan Marg, Chandigarh, 160016
This will open up the following address in Google Maps in your default browser.

If you only pass locate keyword, that is, C:\Users\Abhinav> locate, it will pickup the address parameters that are already copied to your clipboard and work accordingly.
